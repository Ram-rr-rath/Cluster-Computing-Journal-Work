The contents in this repository refer to the work "F2E: Fog-enabled EEG Architecture for Healthcare Services and Computing".

The multi-EEG multi-fog is a new architecture, hence any related work or relevant data simulation is hardly available.
For simulation, we consider
1. a synthetic fog environment dataset of 12 different fog configurations
2. a synthetic EEG dataset of 6 different device configurations
3. a benchmark EEG dataset "Bonn University EEG Dataset"


The excel sheet "Synthetic Dataset Description" is attched, containing information about synthtic datasets.
